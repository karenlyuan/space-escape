# 🚀✨ Space Escape
By Chris Shimoon and Karen Yuan

## 🪐 Overview
The goal of our game is to move the rocket ship to the other side of the screen to get to the highest level possible while avoiding the asteroids that come down the screen in waves vertically at increasing speeds.

## ☄️ Levels
There are various levels of the game, where each level has faster asteroids to increase the difficulty of the rocket ship to reach the other side of the screen. It gets more difficult for the rocket ship to reach the end of the screen to move on to the next level.

## 🌠 Future Plans
One feature we hope to implemenet in the future are to include a shooting ability for the rocket ship to destory the asteroids. We would also like to include more colorful graphics like planets and aliens in the background. Lastly, we hope to implement more accurate collisions in the game.
